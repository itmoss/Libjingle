This Libjingle project based version 0.6.14. 

#Describe
this code customized suit to ubuntu ,it worked well.
But Calling example doesn't work correctly, "Add friends" and "getdevice" commands these functions will occur "segments faults"
So just use built libjingle.a and so on.

Of course , I have plan to improve this code when i have get the free time.
